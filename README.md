CoRrEcTiNg An OvErSiGhT iN hTmL

A `<sponge-case>` web component for your website.

Source: [sponge-case.js](https://github.com/MWDelaney/sponge-case/blob/main/src/sponge-case.js)

HTML includes tags for text styling, like `<strong>` and `<em>`, which help convey the intent or emotion behind a piece of text, but HTML does not yet support Sponge-Case, an important text style for mocking individuals on the internet.

## How can I use Sponge-Case on my website?
```html
<sponge-case>Automatically convert any text to sponge-case.</sponge-case>
<script type="module" src="sponge-case.js"></script>
```
